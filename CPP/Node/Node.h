/*
    *   Name: Node.h
    *   
    *   Define a generic class that represents a node in a singly linked list.
    *   The Node class should have: a generic data field, 
    *   a pointer to the next node in the list,
    *   a constructor that takes the data as a parameter,
    *   and a destructor that deletes the next node. 
    * 
    *   Test your Node in main.cpp
